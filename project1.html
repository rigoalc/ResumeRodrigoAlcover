The second page will display your resume or something similar to a resume.  You can name it whatever you like, but I suggest you name it project1.html
At a minimum, include five sections:
Something along the lines of Name, Contact Information, Goal, Career History, Education History
Please include Horizontal Rules between your sections
Be sure to put at least two links (maybe your high school, and a company where you worked) on your resume.
You must also include a list (either ordered or unordered) on your page.
Also, include a picture on your resume.
Make sure the link from your default page accurately links to your project 1 work.
Make sure that all of your pages validate using the W3 Validator (Links to an external site.). -->
